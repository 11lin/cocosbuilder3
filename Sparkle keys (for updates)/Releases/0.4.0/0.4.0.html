						<p>CocosBuilder now has support for multiple documents. Note that there are still no indications that a document has been edited, so remember to save them. (This will be fixed in CocosBuilder 0.6)</p>
						<p>Support for sprite sheets and jpg images has been added</p>
						<p>Lots of stability fixes, and the look of the application has got a face lift!</p>
						<p>From now on, new versions of CocosBuilder will be able to read files from version 0.4 and newer.</p>
